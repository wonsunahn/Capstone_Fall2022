## FINAL PAPER

This final paper is required for all students in the Capstone, including internship (CS 1900) and research (CS 1950) students.

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

The paper must be 8 - 12 pages in length, double-spaced, using a relatively standard font and point size (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern).  Judicious use of charts, graphs, and/or illustrations is acceptable.  Margins should be of standard size.

Please ensure that your name as well as the name of the project you worked on is listed, along with your faculty advisor (whoever signed your Faculty Learning Agreement, or your research advisor).

## DETAILS

The final paper should describe what you did for the capstone, and how you did it.  This will obviously vary dramatically based on if you did a research project or an internship.  Thus, it is difficult to give a broad-enough description of what is required for all of these.  Consider the following as a list of possible topics to discuss, not as a checklist.

1. What programming language did you use?  Why?
2. Were there things about the choice of language you liked?  Disliked?
3. What frameworks did you use?
4. How did you handle clarifying requirements?
5. What technical problems did you face?
6. How did you ensure quality code?
7. What kind of testing did you do?
8. What was the development process like?
9. How did you communicate with other developers/testers/customers/etc?
10. Did you have non-technical problems that you had to face?
11. What were the biggest challenges you faced during the capstone?
12. Were you able to take what you learned during the capstone and apply it to classes?  Conversely, were you able to use what you learned in class for the capstone project?
13. How did you design the software you were writing?
14. Did you present the project to customers?  How did you plan for it?
15. What was day-to-day life like?
16. Did you have a mentor?  What did they teach you?
17. What was the worst part of the capstone project?
18. How did you deal with ambiguity in requirements or direction?
19. Did you learn any interesting skills during the capstone project?

In general, what I would like to see is a good understanding of what you did, and what you learned, doing the work for the capstone.  If you worked on anything sensitive (e.g., for a government contractor or private data for a company), you do not need to refer to it in your write-up.  If there is any doubt, you may wish to show your supervisor the paper so that they may review it before turning it in.

## Paper Organization

At below are organizations for either internships or research
apprenticeships.  Please feel free to use your own organization.  **Regardless
of what organization you use, your paper should be organized
hierarchically into sections / subsections with corresponding section /
subsection headers.**  Each section should focus on the topic described in the
section header.  A section should comprise of one or more paragraphs that
are also well-focused.

Inserting figures or graphs that describe your implementation or the
outcomes is highly encouraged.  A picture is often worth a thousand words.

### Example organization for CS 1900 students

1. Introduction
    1. The company and what types of products it makes.
    1. Placement of my team in the organization.
    1. How the rest of the paper is organized.
    
1. Project 1
    1. Objectives / Motivation
        1. Business need for my work.
        1. Expected final outcome of my project.
    1. Implementation
        1. Overall software / hardware architecture
        1. Programming languages, frameworks, and tools used.
    1. Technical challenges and how I resolved them (if relevant).
    1. Non-technical challenges (client communication etc., if relevant)
    1. Outcome
        1. Final outcomes of my project.
        1. Business impact of the outcomes.

1. Project 2
    1. Objectives / Motivation
        1. Business need for my work.
        1. Expected final outcome of my project.
    1. Implementation
        1. Overall software / hardware architecture
        1. Programming languages, frameworks, and tools used.
    1. Technical challenges and how I resolved them (if relevant).
    1. Non-technical challenges (client communication etc., if relevant)
    1. Outcome
        1. Final outcomes of my project.
        1. Business impact of the outcomes.
        
1. Issues and reflections
    1. Reflection on what I learned from the internship.  Were you able to fulfill all your learning goals?
    1. Issues in your organization that prevented you from reaching those goals (e.g. supervisor did not mentor you, there were organizational barriers, or employer changed goals when you got there).

### Example organization for CS 1950 students

1. Introduction
    1. Research group and the area of research.
    1. Research question that motivated this research.
    1. Talk about how the rest of the paper is going to be organized.

1. Background
    1. Concepts, tools, pre-existing work that is necessary for understanding the contributions (with subsections for each).
    * Limit the background to what is necessary to understand your work (for a CS undergrad).

3. Contribution
    1. Contributions of research to the state-of-the-art.
    1. My own contributions to the research.
  
1. Implementation
    1. Description of implementation at a high level with details in subsections.
    1. Programming languages, frameworks, or tools used.
    1. Technical / research challenges and how I resolved them.
    
1. Outcome
    1. Final outcomes of my project(s).
    1. Impact of the outcomes to research.

1. Issues and reflections
    1. Reflection on what I learned from the internship.  Did you learn something new and exciting?
    1. Issues that prevented you from reaching those goals (e.g. advisor did not mentor you, did not have time to learn background for research, or advisor set to high expectations).
