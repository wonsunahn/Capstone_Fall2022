## Your responsibilities

You must fulfill all of these responsibilities to get a satisfactory grade:

1. Attend each class synchronously.  See [Attendance](#attendance).

1. Give a presentation on your work.  See [Presentation organization](#presentation-organization).

1. Write a final paper.  See [Final paper organization](#final-paper-organization).

1. Fill out peer reviews for each presentation on TopHat.  See [Peer review organization](#peer-review-organization)

1. (CS 1950 students only) send regular progress reports.  See [Progress report organization](#progress-report-organization).

Failure to fulfill any of the above responsibilities may result in a "Not
Complete" grade or a penalty on your letter grade.

## Attendance

* TopHat attendance will be taken for each class.

* Attendance must occur in-person.  If you have extenuating circumstance
  (such as a medical or family emergency), please let me know immediately
and I will allow remote particiation or other means of participation.

* **NOTE:** You may miss **2 classes** in the entire semester without an
  extenuating circumstance.  3 or more missed classes will result in a
failure.


## Presentation organization

* Poll has closed, please refer to the finalized schedules:
  * [Presentation Schedule (1010 Section)]({{site.baseurl}}/internship_presentation_schedule_1010)
  * [Presentation Schedule (1015 Section)]({{site.baseurl}}/internship_presentation_schedule_1015)

* There will be typically 5 students presenting each day.  That means 50 / 5 =
  10 minutes per student.  Those 10 minutes is going to be broken down as
follows:
  * **8 minutes**: Presentation talk
    * Speaker: Presents slides pre-uploaded to TopHat using instructor's
      laptop.
    * Audience: (If any) ask questions on Microsoft Teams.
  * **2 minutes**: Intermission
    * Current speaker: Returns to seat then starts answering questions on
      Microsoft Teams.  If you don't finish, make sure you finish by the end of
the day please.
    * Next speaker: Immediately steps up to podium and starts preparing.
    * Audience: Takes notes for [peer reviews](#peer-review-organization).
      Peer reviews are due midnight on TopHat.
  * Speakers: Please keep your own time with your cell phone.  Please
    understand that I have to cut you off at 9 minutes with no warning due to
the tight schedule.
  * Audience: Asking questions is optional (unlike peer reviews which are
    mandatory).  Please only ask questions that you are genuinely curious
about.  Also, if you see your question already asked on Teams, just gives a
thumbs up so that the presenter does not have to answer twice.  

* Please review the [Lecture on Presentations](/lectures/lecture-on-presentations-internship.pdf) and the [Lecture on
  Assertion Evidence Format](/lectures/lecture-on-assertion-evidence-format.pdf) before giving your presentation.  

* Presenters must submit their presentation slides to the "Presentation Slides"
  assignment on Canvas the day before, by **Thursday 9:00 PM**.  The slides
will be uploaded to TopHat so that they can be reviewed by your classmates.
The preferred format is PDF or Powerpoint.  

* Recordings of presenters are uploaded to Canvas Panopto within an hour of the
  talk.  Watching a recording of your own talk can be an enlightening
experience (you can trust me on this).

* **NOTE:** If your presentation is not satisfactory, you will be asked to
  present once more with your instructor one-on-one outside of class hours.
This will be your final chance to give a satisfactory presentation.

## Final paper organization

* Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience.  For details, see the
[Final Paper Instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper).  PDF format is
preferred.  The paper is to be submitted to Canvas by **Friday midnight 
of the week following your presentation**.

## Peer review organization

* For each presenter, there will be a folder in TopHat containing the slides
  for the presentation and a few peer review questions.  The TopHat questions
should be submitted to TopHat by **Friday midnight on the day of the
presentation**.

* Please do not peer review yourself (obviously).

* Please review [tips for writing a good review]({{site.baseurl}}/review_tips).
  Be specific about what you liked and disliked.

* Peer review scores are anonymized when posted to TopHat --- only score
  averages will be made available to the presenter.  Also the peer reviews
**will not impact the presenter's grade**.  That means you can give honest
feedback and scores without feeling guilty about lowering your friend's
grade.  The purpose is to give constructive feedback so that your friend can
improve.  

* Your scores will also be used to decide the Best Capstone Speaker award,
which is given to three students with the highest overall scores (the sum of
the Content, Organization, and Delivery scores).  Cash prizes of $100, $50,
and $20 will be given to the PittFund$Me accounts of meriting students, as
well as certificates.

## Progress report organization

This section is only for CS 1950 students.

* Please send regular progress reports to both your instructor (me) and
  research advisor by email, before each weekly or bi-weekly meeting.  

* The report allows your research advisor to get a summary update of your
  progress before starting each meeting.  It also allows your instructor to
monitor your progress and spot communication problems before they become a
major issue.  

* The progress reports are meant to help you, not burden you.  The main
  consumer of the report is your research advisor, so you can use whatever
format conveys the information best to your advisor.

* Your advisor will "Approve" your report if your progress is satisfactory ---
  otherwise feedback will be given.
